# Data-Science-Projects
These are projects listed on my resume, which can also show my efforts as a Data Scientist.

The best part of all is my All-NBA Team Predictor. It is a great Data Science project. Start from scraping the data from web and contructing a popular model, end by interpreting the model and discussing the disadvantages of it. Please take some time to read "All-NBA Team Predictor, Notebook.ipynb".
